# Jira Align Client

A thin, uniform interface to Jira Align's REST API 2.0. Works against both
Atlassian Cloud (`*.jiraalign.com`) and self-hosted / on-prem installs.

## Instructions

You are a Jira Align query agent. Authentication, pagination, retries, and
output formatting live in `scripts/`. Do not re-implement any of that logic;
invoke the CLI with the right subcommand and relay results to the user.

### Flavor support

Cloud and on-prem use the same bearer-token authentication flow (the token
is generated on each user's Jira Align **Profile → API Token** page). Flavor
is auto-detected from the base URL (`*.jiraalign.com` → cloud, anything else
→ on-prem) and is informational only — auth headers are identical.

### Configuration location

Credentials live in the shared dropkit config file
`~/.config/dropkit/credentials.env` (mode 0600), written by
`scripts/setup_credentials.sh`. Recognized keys:

| Key | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `JIRAALIGN_BASE_URL` | yes | Cloud: `https://<site>.jiraalign.com`. On-prem: the customer domain. |
| `JIRAALIGN_API_TOKEN` | yes | Personal API Token from Jira Align Profile. |
| `JIRAALIGN_FLAVOR` | no | `cloud` or `onprem`. Auto-detected if unset. |

All keys may be overridden by matching environment variables.

### Security rules (non-negotiable)

- Secrets live only in `~/.config/dropkit/credentials.env` (mode 0600)
  or environment variables. **Never** read that file, print it, or echo
  the token.
- **Never** put the token on the command line. The CLI refuses flags
  like `--token` / `--api-token` / `--bearer` and exits — do not work
  around it.
- If `check` exits 2 (missing or invalid creds), tell the user to run
  `bash scripts/setup_credentials.sh` themselves. It's interactive — do
  not run it for them.

### Step 1: Verify the environment

Ensure dependencies are installed:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then verify connectivity:

```bash
python scripts/jira_align.py check
```

- Exit code 0 → authenticated, proceed.
- Exit code 2 → credentials missing or invalid. Tell the user to run
  `bash scripts/setup_credentials.sh` (interactive — they run it, not you).
  Stop here.

### Step 2: Dispatch to the right subcommand

| Intent | Command |
|---|---|
| Who am I? | `python scripts/jira_align.py whoami` |
| Fetch one record | `python scripts/jira_align.py get <resource> <id>` |
| List / filter a collection | `python scripts/jira_align.py list <resource> [--filter ... --select ... --orderby ... --expand ... --limit ...]` |
| Shortcut: filter only | `python scripts/jira_align.py search <resource> "<$filter expr>"` |
| Create a new record | `python scripts/jira_align.py create <resource> --field KEY=VALUE ...` (or `--data-file body.json`) |
| Update an existing record | `python scripts/jira_align.py update <resource> <id> --field KEY=VALUE ...` (add `--method PATCH` for partial updates) |
| Delete a record | `python scripts/jira_align.py delete <resource> <id> --yes` |
| Endpoint not wrapped above | `python scripts/jira_align.py raw GET <path> [--param k=v ...]` |

Common resources: `epics`, `features`, `stories`, `capabilities`, `themes`,
`tasks`, `defects`, `objectives`, `portfolios`, `programs`, `teams`,
`users`, `sprints`. Pass the resource name exactly as it appears in the
URL segment — mirrors `/rest/align/api/2/<resource>`.

Global flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--format json\|jsonl\|csv` | Output format (default: `json`). Use `jsonl` or `csv` for bulk exports. |
| `--output FILE` | Write to file instead of stdout. Recommended for >100 records. |
| `--verbose` | Debug logging. |
| `--insecure` | Disable TLS verification. Only if the user explicitly asks. |

### Step 3: Building OData filters

Jira Align query options use an OData dialect with a `$` prefix:

- `$filter`: `"state eq 'In Progress' and points gt 5"`
- `$select`: `"id,title,state"`
- `$orderby`: `"modifiedDate desc"`
- `expand` (no `$`): `"ownerUser,milestones"`

Supported operators include `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`, `and`, `or`,
`not`, and string functions like `contains`, `startswith`, `endswith`.
String literals are single-quoted.

### Step 4: Pagination

Jira Align caps a single response at 100 records (`$top` max 100). The CLI
handles this transparently — it issues `$top` + `$skip` requests until the
collection is drained or `--limit` is hit. For very large collections,
combine `--output` with `--format jsonl` so results stream as newline-
delimited JSON without buffering.

### Step 5: Creating and updating records

Writes are real and visible to every user of the instance. Treat them the
same way you would a git push: confirm the intent, show the payload you
are about to send when practical, and prefer PATCH over PUT when the user
only wants to change a couple of fields.

- `create <resource>` sends `POST /rest/align/api/2/<resource>`. Pass the
  body with `--field KEY=VALUE` (repeatable) or `--data-file body.json`.
  `--field` values are parsed as JSON if possible (so `--field points=5`
  sends an integer, `--field isActive=true` sends a boolean, and anything
  that fails to parse is sent as a string). When both are given, `--field`
  entries override keys from the file.
- `update <resource> <id>` sends `PUT` by default, or `PATCH` with
  `--method PATCH`. Use PATCH when the user says "change X" or "set X to
  Y"; use PUT only when they explicitly want to replace the record.
- `delete <resource> <id>` refuses to run without `--yes`. Do not add
  `--yes` unless the user explicitly asked to delete.

Jira Align field names and required fields vary by resource and by
configured custom fields on the instance. If the user's instance rejects
a create with "field X is required", ask the user which value to use or
point them at their Swagger UI — do not invent values.

### Examples

```bash
# Who am I?
python scripts/jira_align.py whoami

# One epic by id, with the owner expanded
python scripts/jira_align.py get epics 1001 --expand ownerUser

# All in-progress features for a given program, just id+title, as CSV
python scripts/jira_align.py list features \
  --filter "state eq 'In Progress' and programID eq 42" \
  --select "id,title,state,points" \
  --orderby "modifiedDate desc" \
  --format csv --output features.csv

# Stories under a specific feature (raw call for nested endpoint)
python scripts/jira_align.py raw GET features/789/stories

# Export every team, streaming as JSON Lines
python scripts/jira_align.py list teams \
  --format jsonl --output teams.jsonl

# Create a new feature in program 42, owned by user 77
python scripts/jira_align.py create features \
  --field title="Onboarding revamp" \
  --field programID=42 \
  --field ownerID=77 \
  --field state="Planned" \
  --field points=8

# Partial update: change an existing feature's state and points only
python scripts/jira_align.py update features 789 \
  --method PATCH \
  --field state="In Progress" \
  --field points=13

# Full replace from a JSON body, with one override
python scripts/jira_align.py update epics 1001 \
  --data-file epic-1001.json \
  --field state="Done"

# Delete a story (requires explicit --yes)
python scripts/jira_align.py delete stories 5432 --yes
```

### Don't

- Don't read `~/.config/dropkit/credentials.env`.
- Don't print or log the API token.
- Don't run `setup_credentials.sh` non-interactively or pipe the token
  into it.
- Don't write your own REST calls to Jira Align — extend the scripts
  instead, and surface the gap to the user if a subcommand is missing.
- Don't assume `--insecure` is safe to add by default. Only when the user
  explicitly says they accept it.
- Don't issue `create`, `update`, or `delete` calls speculatively. Confirm
  the resource, id, and payload with the user first if any of them were
  inferred rather than explicitly stated.
- Don't add `--yes` to a `delete` invocation unless the user explicitly
  asked to delete. There is no undo.
- Don't invent required field values on a create. If the server returns a
  missing-field error, surface it and ask.

### Edge cases

- **Unknown resource**: the API returns 404; the CLI exits with code 3 and
  echoes the server response. Point the user at their instance's Swagger
  UI (`https://<site>/rest/align/api/docs/index.html`) to confirm the
  resource path.
- **Token expired or revoked**: 401 Unauthorized. Exit 2. Tell the user
  to regenerate the token on their Jira Align Profile page and re-run
  `setup_credentials.sh`. Tokens do not expire by time, only when
  manually regenerated or when the user is deactivated.
- **Permission denied for one resource** (403): exit 3. The token is
  valid but the user's Jira Align role does not cover the resource —
  relay the message, don't retry.
- **Large exports**: always use `--output` with `--format jsonl` to keep
  memory bounded. `--format json` buffers the full list before writing.
- **Custom fields**: appear in responses under their configured names.
  Use `--select` to include them; check your instance's field list in
  the Swagger UI if unsure of the exact property name.
